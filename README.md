# SAVVI
This repository accompanies the paper describing a secure, accessible virtual voting infrastructure (SAVVI) and is meant to provide a proof of concept for the onboard encryption components (using VeraCrypt), which would accompany that architecture.

Further information about VeraCrypt is available at the source, here: https://github.com/veracrypt
